GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software
and other kinds of works.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have
freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service
if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it,
that you can change the software and share your changes with others,
and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
rights that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so
that they know their rights.

Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to use, distribute and modify it.

For the developers’ and authors’ protection, the GPL explains that
they are not responsible for the consequences of everyone’s actions
who use that software. For example, if you distribute copies of
this software, you need to make sure that everyone else also
receives or can get the source code. And you must tell them their
rights.

Also, for each copyright holder, the GPL requires that you keep
a copy of this License along with the software. If you make
modifications to this program, you must add a file that describes
your changes. You must not remove the original copyright notice.

This is why we have this license.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. Definitions.

"This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

"Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds
of works, such as semiconductor masks.

"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License. Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of it,
thus forming a work based on the Program. A "secondary" work is
a work based on the Program or on another work that is itself a
secondary work. 

The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it. For a executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a copyrighted work.

This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other
equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice; and that you keep intact all the notices that refer
to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and that you
preserve any other proprietary notices of authorship.

You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as
their license certificates remain in effect.

2. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as
their license certificates remain in effect.

3. You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of
the rights granted or affirmed under this License. You are not
responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.

4. The Program is distributed with the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the
GNU General Public License for more details.

5. You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
along with this program. If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

6. If the program does enable the User to run the Program, this
License does not apply to the results of running the Program.

7. If you use this License to distribute a modified version of
this Program, you must include a copy of this License with it.

8. This License is intended to make it possible for you to use
this code in your projects, but it is not intended to make
it possible for you to use the code in ways that are not
consistent with the spirit of the License. You should respect the
rights of others who have contributed to this Program.

9. The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.
